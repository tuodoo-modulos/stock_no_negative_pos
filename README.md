## We love conventional commits. How I use?;

Conventional Commits is a lightweight convention for writing commit messages. It provides a standard way for people to communicate the changes made to a codebase. This makes it easier to understand the history of a project and to automate tasks such as generating CHANGELOGs.

### Specification
A Conventional Commit message consists of a header, body, and footer. The header is prefixed with a type, which indicates the kind of change made. The type is followed by an optional scope, and a required colon and space.

The following are the valid types:

    `feat: A new feature`
    `fix: A bug fix`
    `docs: Documentation changes`
    `style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (such as whitespace, formatting, or linting)`
    `refactor: A code change that neither adds nor removes functionality`
    `perf: A code change that improves performance`
    `test: A test-related change (adding, removing, or modifying tests)`
    `chore: A non-code change (such as updating dependencies)`

The body of the commit message is a free-form description of the changes made. It should be concise and to the point.

The footer of the commit message is optional. It can be used to include additional information, such as breaking changes or references to related issues.

### Examples
Here are some examples of Conventional Commit messages:

    `feat: Add new feature`
    This commit adds a new feature to the application.

    `docs: Update documentation`
    This commit updates the documentation to reflect the new feature.

    `fix: Fix a bug`
    This commit fixes a bug in the application.

Why use Conventional Commits?

    It makes it easier to understand the history of a project.

    It makes it easier to automate tasks such as generating CHANGELOGs.

    It helps to ensure that commit messages are consistent and easy to read.
